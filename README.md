*Numeric algorithms and scientific computations from scratch*

This repository contains the implementation of some numerical scientific computations from scratch :
- Direct and iterative methods for solving linear systems such as Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, Gauss-Seidel, SOR, etc.
- Root finding methods such as bissection or Newton-Raphson algorithms for functions in **R1**, **C** and **Rn**.
- Optimization methods such as gradient descent (fixed & optimal step), Newton's method and quasi-Newton methods.
- Some numerical analysis methods such as interpolation, numerical integration and differentiation, etc.
